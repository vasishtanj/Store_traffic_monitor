# Store_traffic_monitor script
This is a shell script which was meant to run the model downloader, optimizer, setup enviornment variables, download models and videos in one command
while also allowing the user to choose their target device. However the IEI Tank target may need further setup.
This script is not updated and only runs for OpenVINO R1 and the according version of the Store Traffic Monitor Python reference implementation.
